When writing scripts, the recommended approach is to use service principals. By granting just the appropriate permissions needed to a service principal, you can keep your automation secure.

None of your login information is stored by Azure CLI. Instead, an authentication refresh token is generated by Azure and stored. As of August 2018 this token is revoked after 90 days of inactivity, but this value can be changed by Microsoft or your tenant administrator. Once the token is revoked you get a message from the CLI saying you need to login again.

Depending on your signing in method, your tenant may have Conditional Access policies that restrict your access to certain resources.

The Azure CLI's default authentication method for logins uses a web browser and access token to sign in.
